Agent: "No problem! Let me correct that:
‚Ä¢ Origin: Houston Terminal (corrected) ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Destination: Dallas Hub (corrected) ‚úÖ

So the updated deal is gasoline delivery FROM Houston TO Dallas. Is this correct now?"

User: "Yes, but actually make it weekly, not daily"

Agent: "Got it! Updated to weekly delivery. Here's the corrected deal:
‚Ä¢ Customer: XYZ Corp ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Product: Gasoline ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Quantity: 10,000 gallons ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Origin: Houston Terminal ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Destination: Dallas Hub ‚úÖ

User: "What's the difference in availability between propane and diesel?"

Agent: "Both propane and diesel are readily available for delivery to Fort Worth Hub. For 15,000 gallons:

‚Ä¢ Diesel: Good for commercial/industrial use, standard fleet quantity

Which fuel type fits your needs better?"

User: "Let's go with diesel. What pickup locations are available?"

Agent: "For diesel pickup, I can see several options:
‚Ä¢ Houston Terminal (ID: 100) - Major supply hub
‚Ä¢ Beaumont Terminal (ID: 101) - Gulf Coast refinery area
‚Ä¢ Dallas Terminal (ID: 103) - Closer to Fort Worth destination

Which pickup location works best for you?"

User: "Dallas Terminal makes sense since it's closer"

Agent: "Smart choice! Dallas Terminal to Fort Worth Hub will minimize transport. Who is the customer for this deal?"

User: "Midstream Energy Co"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

```bash
# Agent not responding
Check conversation orchestrator initialization
